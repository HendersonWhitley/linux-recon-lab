# Linux Recon Lab

This project is my first Linux reconnaissance script built while learning cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and penetration testing.

## What this script does
This Bash script performs basic system and network reconnaissance, including:

- Current directory enumeration
- File listing
- Network path tracing
- Open port discovery
- Service visibility

## Commands Used
pwd  
ls  
traceroute google.com  
ss -tuln  

## Why I Built This
I am building hands-on Linux skills to prepare for blue team and red team cybersecurity roles. This lab helps me understand how attackers and defenders gather system information.
